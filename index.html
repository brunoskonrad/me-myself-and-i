        <p>
          I'm a Brazilian living in Berlin since 2017. It's been a while,
          already. Not enough to learn German, though.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm a <strong>Software Developer‚Ñ¢Ô∏è</strong> exploring new horizons on
          my career. I'm currently shifting focus from client-side development
          only towards a full-stack position.

            That is me with my latest quarantine haircut. The funny thing about
            it, despite of the hairstyle, is that I used to wear the same
            haircut when I was about 3.
          </p>
          <p>
            Back then was when I had access to a computer for the first time. My
            father was a big nerd and needed one for work. I guess. Anyway, he
            bought one for the family and I loved it from the first time. I
            played tons of DooM. My mom says I was really good at it.
          </p>

          <p>
            Because of me growing up with computers around, and playing a lot of
            different video-games, I was sure that I wanted to work on the
            gaming industry. Such a clich√©. But then I asked my father what he
            had as a profession. And he told me he was a Software Programmer.

            Then I started coding back in 2009. Its been a long journey, working
            in the industry since the end of 2011. During these years I had the
            opportunity to work on a large variety of projects, teams, companies
            and cultures.
          </p>

          <p>
            I also had the opportunity to work with a range of technologies and
            playing different roles. I've worked with Microsoft technologies and
            open-source technologies. On mobile apps, on web apps. Working on
            the client-side, working on the server-side.
          </p>

          <p>
            Trying out things is always fun and I don't mind getting my hands
            dirty on code. Here goes some things I used in the past:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Mobile</strong>: Android SDK, Phonegap, Xamarin, Ionic and
              React Native
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Web</strong>: Javascript & Typescript, React, Ruby &
              Rails, PHP, Python, .NET with C#
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Remember when I mentioned about my interest in the gaming industry?
            After a decade I finally did it, as a hobby kind of. And I
            implemented my
            <a
              target="_blank"
              href="https://js13kgames.com/entries/back-to-that-platform-i-was-on-before-jumping"
              >first game in a game jam</a
            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm now learning how to use
            <a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot</a>. Also the mathematics,
            physics and other stuff behind a game. By the way, it is a lot.
          </p>

            In summary, this is what I've done and what I'm doing. At the bottom
            of the page you'll find links to my social media, you can check more
            information on my LinkedIn.
          </p>

          <p>Some fun facts about me, then:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              I once co-hosted a podcast for my RPG group. It was a newspapper
              about our campaing, mysteries and news. Also gossips.
            </li>
            <li>
              I'm a bassist. Not a good one, though. But I had a band, on my
              teen ages!
            </li>
            <li>
              Not about me, only, my brother, my parents and I are Pok√©mon
              trainers since always. Umbreon is my favorite Pok√©mon.
            </li>
