        <p>
          I'm a Brazilian living in Berlin since 2017. It's been a while already
          (not enough to learn German, though).
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm a <strong>Software Developer‚Ñ¢Ô∏è</strong> exploring new horizons in
          my career. I'm currently shifting focus from client-side development
          towards a full-stack position. Currently coding @
          <a href="https://www.klara.com/">Klara</a>.

            That is me with my latest quarantine haircut. The funny thing about
            (besides the way it looks) is that I used to have the exact same
            haircut when I was 3.

            It was at that age that I was able to get access to a computer for
            the first time. My father was a big nerd and needed one for work (or
            so he said). Anyway, he bought one for the family and I loved it
            from the first moment. I played tons of DooM. My mom says I was
            really good at it.
          </p>

          <p>
            Because I grew up with computers around, and played a lot of
            different video-games, I was sure that I wanted to work in the
            gaming industry (such a clich√©). But then I asked my father what he
            did for a profession, and he told me he was a Software Programmer.
          </p>

          <p>
            I started coding back in 2009. It's been a long journey. I've been
            working in the industry since the end of 2011. During these years
            I've had the opportunity to work in a wide variety of teams,
            companies and cultures.
          </p>

          <p>
            I've also had the opportunity to work with a range of technologies
            and in different roles. I've worked with Microsoft technologies and
            open-source technologies. On mobile apps, on web apps. Working on
            the client-side, working on the server-side.
          </p>

          <p>
            Trying out things is always fun and I don't mind getting my hands
            dirty building things. Here are some technologies I've used in the
            past:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Mobile</strong>: Android SDK, Phonegap, Xamarin, Ionic and
              React Native
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Web</strong>: Javascript & Typescript, React, Ruby &
              Rails, PHP, Python, .NET with C#
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Remember when I mentioned my interest in the gaming industry? After
            a decade I finally jumped in (as a kind of hobby) and implemented my

              >first game in a game jam</a
            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm now learning how to use
            <a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot</a> (also the mathematics,
            physics and other stuff behind a game). By the way, it is a lot.

            In summary, this is what I've done and what I'm doing. At the bottom
            of the page you'll find links to my social media, you can check out
            more information on my LinkedIn.

          <p>Some fun facts about me:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              I once co-hosted a podcast for my RPG group. It was a newspaper
              about our campaingning, mysteries and news (also gossips).
            </li>
            <li>
              I'm a bassist (not a good one, though). But I had a band in my
              teenage years!
            </li>
            <li>
              Not only about me - my brother, my parents and I are Pok√©mon
              trainers since forever. Umbreon is my favorite Pok√©mon.
